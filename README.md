# DD2424-project
This is a group course project on implementing RNN and LSTM for text generator. The network is based on pytorch and tensorflow structure. Certain tasks on training method (GRU) with different datasets, implementing nucleus sampling method and searching for best parameter is implemented, following with relevant evaluation method. The quantitative metrics used were spelling percentage, term token ratio, perplexity, BLEU score, and BERTScore.
